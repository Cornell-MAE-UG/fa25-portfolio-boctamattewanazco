In our Fluid Mechanics course, we were assigned to disassemble, analyze, and reassemble a fluid machine in order to understand its operation and explain it to other fluid mechanics students. Working in a group of four, we modeled the system as a series of nozzles and investigated how a propane–air mixture was driven to combust. My primary contribution focused on analyzing how the flow evolved across each nozzle and determining how the individual components could be simplified into a single equivalent system. I performed much of the nozzle flow analysis and developed estimates for their combined effects. You can view our final video here.
