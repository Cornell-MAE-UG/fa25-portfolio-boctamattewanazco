In our Fluid Mechanics course, we were tasked with disassembling, analyzing, and reassembling a fluid machine to understand its operation and communicate its behavior to other fluid mechanics students. Working in a team of four, we represented the system as a series of nozzles and examined the conditions that enabled a propane–air mixture to combust. My role centered on system-level understanding and communication, where I helped translate the physical behavior of the flow into clear explanations and visuals for instructional purposes. I also assisted in validating assumptions used in the nozzle models and connecting individual components to the overall system behavior.

I worked on this assignment with Kevin Sturm, Manuely Feliz Portes, and Castiel Li of Cornell University.
