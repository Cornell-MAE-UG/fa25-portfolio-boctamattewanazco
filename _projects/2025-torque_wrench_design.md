For my Mechanics of Materials class, we were assigned to mathematically design a torque wrench that could safely sustain loads of up to 600 in-lbf. The goal of the project was to choose appropriate materials and dimensions using a combination of hand calculations and computer-based tools. We used classical mechanics of materials concepts to size the wrench, then modeled the final design in Fusion to create the geometry. The design was further analyzed in ANSYS to evaluate stress, strain, and deformation under the applied loading and to confirm that the hand calculations were reasonable.

I worked on this assignment with Ethan Hernandez of Cornell University, collaborating on the design approach, calculations, and overall analysis while producing individual models and simulations.

Here is the complete assignment in PDF format.
